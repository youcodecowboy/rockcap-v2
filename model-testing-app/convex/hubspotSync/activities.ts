/**
 * Activities sync module (placeholder for future implementation)
 * 
 * This module will handle syncing HubSpot activities (calls, emails, meetings, notes, etc.)
 * to the unified activities table that can link to contacts, companies, and deals.
 * 
 * Activities can be associated with multiple entities:
 * - Contacts
 * - Companies
 * - Deals
 * 
 * Future implementation will:
 * 1. Fetch activities from HubSpot API
 * 2. Map activity types (call, email, meeting, note, task, etc.)
 * 3. Link activities to contacts, companies, and deals
 * 4. Store activity metadata and custom properties
 * 5. Handle activity deduplication
