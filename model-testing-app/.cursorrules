# Cursor Rules

## Changelog Management

The changelog is accessible at `/settings/changelog` in the application. When entries are added, all users automatically receive notifications.

### Adding Changelog Entries

To add a changelog entry, use:
```bash
npx convex run changelog:add '{
  "title": "Brief Title of the Change",
  "description": "Detailed description of what changed and why.",
  "pagesAffected": ["Page Name 1", "Page Name 2"],
  "featuresAffected": ["Feature Name 1", "Feature Name 2"]
}'
```

### Standards & Guidelines

See `docs/CHANGELOG_STANDARDS.md` for:
- Complete entry structure and required fields
- Change type categories and auto-detection
- Page and feature name references
- Style guidelines and examples
- Best practices
