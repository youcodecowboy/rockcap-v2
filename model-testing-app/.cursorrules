# Cursor Rules

## Changelog Management

When making changes to the application, especially for new features, new pages, or larger changes:

1. **Automatic Updates**: The changelog is automatically updated via GitHub webhook on every push to the repository. Each commit message becomes a changelog entry.

2. **Manual Updates**: For manual changelog entries, use the Convex mutation:
   ```typescript
   import { useMutation } from 'convex/react';
   import { api } from '@/convex/_generated/api';
   
   const addChangelogEntry = useMutation(api.changelog.add);
   await addChangelogEntry({ description: 'Short description of the change' });
   ```

3. **Changelog Location**: The changelog is accessible at `/settings/changelog` in the application.

4. **Best Practices**:
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages as they become changelog entries
   - Include the branch name in commit messages when relevant
   - Keep descriptions concise but informative
   - Use present tense (e.g., "Add new feature" not "Added new feature")

5. **GitHub Webhook Setup**:
   - Webhook URL: `/api/changelog/github-webhook`
   - Requires `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variable
   - Configure in GitHub repository settings → Webhooks
   - Select "push" events only
