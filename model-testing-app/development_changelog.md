### Intelligence Data Library Fixes - Subtotal Filtering & Client Aggregation

**Two key fixes to ensure accurate data in Intelligence views:**

#### 1. Project Intelligence - Subtotal Filtering

The Project Intelligence `dataLibrarySummary` was including subtotals in calculations, causing inflated totals.

**Changes** (`convex/intelligence.ts`):
- `syncDataLibraryToIntelligence` now filters out items where `isSubtotal === true`
- `internalSyncDataLibrary` updated with same subtotal filtering logic
- Category totals and totalDevelopmentCost now exclude subtotal items

#### 2. Client Intelligence - Data Library Aggregation

Client Intelligence was not receiving any aggregated data from projects, showing empty data sections.

**Schema Updates** (`convex/schema.ts`):
- Added `dataLibraryAggregate` field to `clientIntelligence`:
  - `totalDevelopmentCostAllProjects` - Sum across all client projects
  - `totalItemCount` - Total data items across all projects
  - `totalDocumentCount` - Unique source documents
  - `projectCount` - Number of projects with data
  - `categoryTotals` - Aggregated category breakdown
- Enhanced `projectSummaries` to include per-project `dataSummary`:
  - `totalDevelopmentCost`, `itemCount`, `categoryCount`

**Sync Updates** (`convex/intelligence.ts`):
- `syncProjectSummariesToClient` now:
  - Fetches all `projectDataItems` for each client project
  - Aggregates totals excluding subtotals
  - Builds `dataLibraryAggregate` with cross-project sums
  - Includes per-project `dataSummary` in `projectSummaries`

**UI Updates** (`src/components/IntelligenceTab.tsx`):
- Added "Data Library" category to Client Intelligence sidebar
- Shows:
  - Total development cost across all projects
  - Project count, document count, item count
  - Per-project breakdown with dev cost and item counts
  - Category totals aggregated across all projects
- Projects section now shows data summary for each project

**Migration** (`convex/migrations/resyncIntelligence.ts`):
- `previewResync` - Shows what will be updated
- `resyncAll` - Flags subtotals + resyncs all project & client intelligence
- `resyncProject` - Resync all projects
- `resyncClients` - Resync all clients

**Run migration**: `npx convex run migrations/resyncIntelligence:resyncAll`

### Client Data Tab - Project Sidebar & Subtotal Detection

**Two key improvements to the Data Library functionality:**

#### 1. Client Data Tab - Project Selection Sidebar

The Client Data Tab now has a sidebar navigation for selecting which project's data to view, preventing data from different projects from being mixed together.

**Changes** (`src/app/clients/[clientId]/components/ClientDataTab.tsx`):
- Added project sidebar with list of all projects for the client
- Each project shows item count
- Auto-selects first project when page loads
- Search and expand/collapse controls for data items
- "View Project" link to navigate to project detail page
- Subtotal items are displayed with visual distinction (italic, gray, "subtotal" badge)

#### 2. Subtotal Detection & Exclusion

Subtotals extracted from Excel files are now automatically detected and excluded from category totals to prevent double-counting.

**Schema Updates** (`convex/schema.ts`):
- Added `isSubtotal` (boolean) and `subtotalReason` (string) fields to `projectDataItems`

**Extraction Updates** (`src/lib/fastPassCodification.ts`):
- Added `detectSubtotal()` function with comprehensive patterns:
  - "Total...", "...total"
  - "Sub-total", "Subtotal"
  - "Grand total", "Net total", "Gross total"
  - "Section total", "Category total"
  - Numbered total rows
- Updated `CodifiedItem` interface with `isSubtotal` and `subtotalReason`
- Both `runFastPass` and `runFastPassWithFuzzy` now detect and flag subtotals

**Codification Updates** (`convex/codifiedExtractions.ts`):
- Added `isSubtotal` and `subtotalReason` to `codifiedItemValidator`

**Data Library Updates** (`convex/projectDataLibrary.ts`):
- `mergeExtractionToLibrary` now carries over `isSubtotal` and `subtotalReason`
- `getProjectLibrary` excludes subtotals from category total calculations

**UI Updates**:
- Both `ClientDataTab` and `ProjectDataTab` now:
  - Exclude subtotals from category totals
  - Display subtotal items with visual distinction (gray, italic, "subtotal" badge)

**Result**: Category totals now accurately reflect actual costs without double-counting subtotal rows that were extracted from Excel files.

### Bulk Upload Extraction Queue System

**Major Improvement**: Completely redesigned the data extraction flow to fix the projectId assignment issue and improve UX.

**Problem Solved**:
- Previously, data extraction ran inline during bulk upload BEFORE project assignment
- This caused `projectId` to be missing from extractions, breaking the data flow to Intelligence
- Users had to wait on the page during extraction

**New Queue-Based Architecture**:

1. **Extraction Jobs Table** (`convex/schema.ts`):
   - New `extractionJobs` table to track background extraction processing
   - Status tracking: pending, processing, completed, failed
   - Retry support with max attempts

2. **Background Processing** (`convex/extractionJobs.ts`):
   - Full job lifecycle management
   - Automatic retry on failure
   - Intelligence sync triggers after completion

3. **Queue Processor API** (`src/app/api/process-extraction-queue/route.ts`):
   - Processes pending extraction jobs
   - Fetches files from Convex storage
   - Runs full extraction pipeline (extract → normalize → verify)
   - Runs FastPass codification with CORRECT projectId
   - Creates codified extraction with proper project linkage

4. **Updated Filing Process** (`convex/bulkUpload.ts`):
   - Creates extraction jobs AFTER documents are filed
   - Ensures projectId is always set correctly
   - Triggers queue processing automatically after filing

5. **Updated UI** (`src/components/BulkReviewTable.tsx`):
   - Extraction is now a simple toggle (not inline execution)
   - Clear messaging that extraction runs after filing
   - Users can leave the page - extraction runs in background

6. **Data Library Enhancements** (`src/app/clients/[clientId]/projects/[projectId]/components/ProjectDataTab.tsx`):
   - New `getPendingExtractions` query shows extraction status
   - Banner displays pending/processing extractions
   - Links to Modeling section for confirmation

**User Flow After Changes**:
1. User uploads documents in Bulk Upload
2. User toggles "Extract" for spreadsheets they want data from
3. User confirms filing location and clicks "File All Documents"
4. Documents are filed FIRST (with correct projectId)
5. Extraction jobs are created and processed in background
6. User can navigate away - no waiting required
7. Data appears in Data Library with "Pending Confirmation" banner
8. User goes to Modeling to confirm codified values
9. After confirmation, data syncs to Intelligence

### Data Library & Intelligence Connections Overhaul

**Major Fix**: Fixed broken connections between Data Library, Intelligence, and Client/Project relationships.

**Schema Fix** (`convex/schema.ts`):
- Changed `clientRoles[].clientId` from `v.string()` to `v.id("clients")` to fix type mismatch issues in sync queries

**Automatic Sync Triggers**:
- **After Item Confirmation** (`convex/codifiedExtractions.ts`):
  - `confirmItem` and `confirmAllSuggested` now automatically trigger `mergeExtractionToLibrary` when all items are confirmed
- **After Merge to Library** (`convex/projectDataLibrary.ts`):
  - `mergeExtractionToLibrary` now automatically triggers:
    - `syncDataLibraryToIntelligence` to update project intelligence
    - `syncProjectSummariesToClient` for all associated clients

**New Project Data Tab** (`src/app/clients/[clientId]/projects/[projectId]/components/ProjectDataTab.tsx`):
- Replaced placeholder with full-featured Data Library view
- Shows all data items for the project with category grouping
- Category totals for currency items
- Search and filter by category
- Source document and update timestamps
- Multi-source indicator for items with multiple document sources

**Data Flow After Fix**:
1. User uploads document -> Document analyzed -> Data extracted (codified)
2. User confirms all items -> `mergeExtractionToLibrary` triggered
3. After merge -> `syncDataLibraryToIntelligence` triggered
4. After sync -> `syncProjectSummariesToClient` triggered for all clients
5. All views (Project Data Tab, Client Data Tab, Project Intelligence, Client Intelligence) now show correct data

### Codebase Quality Audit & TypeScript Fixes

**Production Build Blockers Fixed**: Resolved all 7 TypeScript compilation errors that were blocking production builds.

**TypeScript Fixes**:
- `src/lib/codifiedTemplatePopulator.ts` - Removed duplicate 'development' key in CATEGORY_NORMALIZATIONS object (was mapped to both 'construction.costs' and 'plots')
- `src/app/api/bulk-analyze/route.ts` - Fixed 4 calls to non-existent `ErrorResponses.internal()`, changed to `ErrorResponses.internalError()`
- `src/components/BulkUpload.tsx` - Reordered variable declarations so `selectedProject` useMemo is defined before `editShortcodeAvailable` query that references it
- `convex/clients.ts` - Added `@ts-ignore` comment for Convex scheduler deep type instantiation issue (consistent with pattern used elsewhere in codebase)

**Code Cleanup - Console.log Reduction**:
Removed verbose debug logging from production API routes (118 → 55 statements, 53% reduction):
- `src/app/api/analyze-file/route.ts` - Removed 35 debug logs, kept error logs
- `src/app/api/chat-assistant/route.ts` - Removed iteration tracking logs

### Excel Clone Fixes - Formula Bar, Formatting Toolbar & Zoom

**Fixed Formula Bar Not Displaying Cell Values** (`src/components/WorkbookEditor.tsx`):
- Root cause: Stale closure in `afterSelection` callback was capturing outdated refs
- Fix: Now gets cell values directly from `hotTableRefs.current.get(sheet.name).hotInstance`
- Formula detection still works via HyperFormula service
- No more `setTimeout` delay - immediate value display

**Fixed Formatting Toolbar (Bold, Italic, Colors)** (`src/components/WorkbookEditor.tsx`, `src/app/globals.css`):
- Root cause: Custom renderers in `cells` callback were applying inline styles that overrode CSS classes
- Fix: Removed inline style application from custom renderers
- `handleFormatChange` now only uses `setCellMeta(row, col, 'className', ...)` 
- Added CSS classes: `.cell-bold`, `.cell-italic`, `.cell-underline`, `.cell-color-*`, `.cell-bg-*`
- Handsontable now automatically applies className from metadata (no custom renderer interference)
- Number formatting (currency, percentage, date) still uses custom renderer but ONLY for textContent modification

**Fixed Zoom Using Native Handsontable Properties** (`src/components/WorkbookEditor.tsx`, `src/app/globals.css`):
- Replaced CSS `transform: scale()` with native Handsontable approach
- Added `rowHeights={Math.round(23 * zoomLevel)}` for scaled row heights
- Added `colWidths` function that scales with zoomLevel
- Added `.zoom-level-*` CSS classes for font-size scaling
- Container maintains 100% dimensions at all zoom levels

**Fixed Formula Autocomplete Selection** (`src/components/FormulaEditor.tsx`):
- Added `mousedown` event prevention on autocomplete container
- Prevents editor from losing focus when clicking on formula suggestions
- Reordered operations in `selectFunction()` for reliable insertion

**New CSS Classes** (`src/app/globals.css`):
- `.cell-bold`, `.cell-italic`, `.cell-underline` - text formatting
- `.cell-color-*` (black, white, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, gray) - text colors
- `.cell-bg-*` (same colors) - background colors  
- `.zoom-level-50` through `.zoom-level-100` - font size scaling
- `.formula-cell-highlight` - formula cell styling

### Excel Clone Overhaul - Phase 1: UI, Formatting & Performance

**Major UI Consolidation** (`src/app/modeling/page.tsx`):
- Unified toolbar: Removed separate "Run Model" dropdown and "New Scenario" button when viewing a model
- Renamed "Save Scenario" → "Save Model" for clarity
- Moved sheet dropdown to right side of unified toolbar
- Removed Input/Output tabs - streamlined to single model view
- Added model name display when a template is loaded
- Toolbar uses flex layout with proper overflow handling to prevent page-level horizontal scroll

**FormulaBar Improvements** (`src/components/FormulaBar.tsx`):
- Made formula input responsive: `flex: 1` with `min-width: 120px` and `max-width: 400px`
- Container uses `overflow: hidden` to prevent toolbar overflow
- All child elements properly use `flex-shrink-0` or `min-width: 0` for responsive behavior
- Improved formula autocomplete trigger - now shows for any formula query

**Enhanced Formula Autocomplete** (`src/components/FormulaAutocomplete.tsx`):
- Expanded from 9 to 100+ formulas covering: Math, Statistical, Logical, Text, Date/Time, Lookup, Financial, Information
- Added category tabs for easy filtering (All, Math, Statistical, Logical, Text, Date, Lookup, Financial)
- Improved search: exact match priority, then starts-with, then includes
- Added keyboard navigation hints in footer
- Tab key cycles through categories
- Viewport-aware positioning to prevent overflow
- Shows up to 20 results with "+X more" indicator

**Formatting Toolbar Compactness** (`src/components/FormattingToolbar.tsx`, `src/components/NumberFormatToolbar.tsx`):
- Reduced button sizes: `h-7 w-7` with `w-3.5 h-3.5` icons
- Removed text labels - icons only with tooltips
- Color pickers positioned to right to prevent overflow
- Higher z-index for dropdowns to avoid clipping

**Fixed Number Formatting Persistence** (`src/components/WorkbookEditor.tsx`):
- Fixed closure issue in cell renderers - formats now stored directly in cell metadata via `cellProperties.numberFormat`
- Added Excel serial date conversion helper `excelSerialToDate()`
- Improved currency formatting with proper negative number handling (shows in red)
- Fixed percentage formatting (value × 100)
- Added proper thousands separator handling with decimal support

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Increased viewport offsets: `viewportRowRenderingOffset: 100`, `viewportColumnRenderingOffset: 15`
- Added `renderAllRows: false`, `renderAllColumns: false` for virtualization
- Enhanced `HyperFormulaService.syncCellChanges()` - suspends evaluation for batches > 50 changes
- Added `bulkSetCells()` method for efficient initial data loading
- Data change handler already has 200ms throttling per sheet

### Advanced Placeholder Priority Rules & Multi-Sheet Support

**Three Distinct Placeholder Behaviors** (`src/lib/codifiedTemplatePopulator.ts`):

1. **Specific Codes** - Fill ALL occurrences everywhere, unlimited
   - `<stamp.duty>` can appear 100 times across all sheets
   - Every occurrence gets the same value

2. **Default Category Fallbacks** - Per-sheet deduplication
   - `<all.plots.name>` excludes items matched to specific placeholders ON THE SAME SHEET
   - Same item CAN appear in fallbacks on different sheets

3. **Numbered Sets** - Full copy, no deduplication
   - `<all.plots.name.1>` gets ALL items regardless of specific placements
   - Use for summary sections that need complete lists even when items appear elsewhere

**Per-Sheet Tracking**:
- Changed from global `matchedItemIds` Set to per-sheet `Map<sheetIndex, Set<string>>`
- Track which items are matched on each specific sheet
- Enable items to appear on multiple sheets via both specific and fallback placeholders

**New Regex Patterns**:
- `CATEGORY_FALLBACK_PATTERN`: Matches default fallbacks `<all.category.name>` (excludes numbered)
- `NUMBERED_SET_PATTERN`: Matches numbered sets `<all.category.name.1>`

**Updated Instructions Tab** (`src/components/ModelingSettings.tsx`):
- Added "Section 5: Advanced Multi-Sheet & Numbered Sets"
- Clear documentation of three placeholder types with examples
- Example table showing specific + default + numbered behavior on same sheet
- When to use numbered sets guidance

**Example Scenario**:
```
Sheet 1:
  <plot.1>                    → Plot 1 (specific)
  <plot.2>                    → Plot 2 (specific)
  <all.plots.name>            → Plot 3, Unit Count (excludes 1 & 2)
  <all.plots.name.1>          → Plot 1, 2, 3, Unit Count (full copy)

Sheet 2:
  <all.plots.name>            → Plot 1, 2, 3, Unit Count (ALL items - no specifics on Sheet 2)
```

  - Profit: profits, margin, returns
  - Other: uncategorized, miscellaneous, misc, general

**Detailed Population Summary Logging**:
- Added comprehensive logging at start of template population
- Shows items by status (matched, confirmed, suggested, pending_review, unmatched)
- Shows items by raw category with their normalized form
- Shows usable items ready for category fallback by normalized category
- Helps diagnose why categories aren't populating

**Auto Fast Pass on Document Save**:

- Added to `src/app/uploads/[jobId]/page.tsx` after document creation
- Added to `src/components/FileAssignmentCard.tsx` after document creation
- Creates `codifiedExtractions` record in database immediately (not just preview)
- Non-blocking - doesn't slow down document save flow

**Debug Codification Endpoint** (`src/app/api/debug-codification/route.ts`):
- New endpoint: GET `/api/debug-codification?documentId=xxx`
- Returns detailed diagnostic information:
  - Current extraction items with categories and statuses
  - Category normalization mappings
  - Usable items by normalized category
  - Items grouped by status
  - Supported fallback patterns
  - Troubleshooting tips

**Refresh Population Button** (`src/app/modeling/page.tsx`):
- Replaced legacy "Refresh Data" button with green refresh icon
- Uses new codified data system (not legacy placeholder mapping)
- Re-runs `populateTemplateWithCodifiedData()` from original template
- Shows amber color when not all items are confirmed
- Works with confirmed and matched items only

- Shows `<all.{category}.name>` and `<all.{category}.value>` patterns
- Highlighted in amber for visibility

---

## [Previous] - 2025-12-03 22:00

### Simplified Category Fallback Placeholders

**New Simplified Format** (`src/lib/codifiedTemplatePopulator.ts`):
- Changed from numbered format `<all.category.1.name>` to simplified `<all.category.name>`
- Same placeholder can be used on multiple rows - system fills them sequentially (FIFO)
- Rows are detected by scanning all sheets for paired name/value placeholders on the same row
- Top-to-bottom filling: first row gets first unmatched item, second row gets second, etc.

**Manual Cleanup Button** (`src/app/modeling/page.tsx`):
- Added "Clear Unused" button in the Population Status bar
- Shows count of remaining unfilled placeholders
- User can see what's missing before manually clearing
- Clicking clears all remaining `<...>` placeholders from the template

**New Utility Functions**:
- `clearUnusedPlaceholders()` - Removes all unfilled placeholder patterns from sheets
- `countRemainingPlaceholders()` - Returns count and breakdown of unfilled placeholders

**Updated Instructions** (`src/components/ModelingSettings.tsx`):
- Instructions tab now documents the simplified format
- Example shows identical placeholders on consecutive rows
- FIFO row filling explained clearly

**Example Template Setup**:
```
Row 5: <all.professional.fees.name>  | <all.professional.fees.value>
Row 6: <all.professional.fees.name>  | <all.professional.fees.value>
Row 7: <all.professional.fees.name>  | <all.professional.fees.value>
```
When populated with 2 items (Architect £5000, Surveyor £3000):
```
Row 5: Architect Fees              | 5000
Row 6: Surveyor Fees               | 3000
Row 7: <all.professional.fees.name>| <all.professional.fees.value>  <- unfilled, click "Clear Unused"
```

### HyperFormula Integration Refactor & Fortification

**New HyperFormulaService** (`src/lib/hyperFormulaService.ts`):
- Created centralized service class for HyperFormula engine management
- Synchronous engine initialization (critical for proper Handsontable integration)
- Proper lifecycle management with safe destruction to prevent "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
- Built-in sheetId lookups for multi-sheet workbooks
- Bidirectional data synchronization methods (`syncSheetData`, `syncCellChanges`)
- Formula value change subscription via `onValuesUpdated` listener
- Batch operations support with `suspendEvaluation`/`resumeEvaluation`
- Proper `licenseKey: 'gpl-v3'` configuration

**WorkbookEditor Refactor** (`src/components/WorkbookEditor.tsx`):
- Migrated from direct HyperFormula usage to HyperFormulaService
- Added `sheetId` to formulas plugin config (critical fix - was missing before)
- Added `afterChange` hook to sync user edits to HyperFormula engine
- Added `onValuesUpdated` listener for formula result propagation back to Handsontable
- Removed row truncation limit (was 2000 rows) - formulas now work on full sheets
- Conditional rendering: HotTable only renders when engine is fully ready
- Proper cleanup on unmount - clears Formulas plugin engine reference before destroying
- Fixed formula bar display for formula cells

**Key Fixes**:
1. **Missing `sheetId`**: Each HotTable now correctly references its sheet in the shared engine
2. **Async init race condition**: Engine now initializes synchronously before render
3. **No bidirectional sync**: User edits are now synced to HyperFormula via `setCellContents`
4. **Data copy mismatch**: When sheets change, engine is re-initialized with new data
5. **Formula display**: Formula bar correctly shows formula text for formula cells

**Technical Details**:
- HyperFormula maintains its OWN internal copy of data
- When `populateTemplateWithCodifiedData` modifies sheet.data, WorkbookEditor detects the change and re-initializes the engine
- Formulas starting with `=` are automatically recognized by `buildFromSheets`
- Each `HotTable` gets formulas config with `{ engine, sheetId, sheetName }`

**Category Fallback Placeholder System** (`src/lib/codifiedTemplatePopulator.ts`):
- New placeholder format: `<all.{category}.{n}.name>` and `<all.{category}.{n}.value>`
- Paired placeholders for inserting unmatched items by category
- FIFO population: items fill slots 1, 2, 3... in order
- Unfilled slots are cleared (empty string)
- Supports category normalization (e.g., "Professional Fees" → "professional.fees")

**Population Logic (Three-Pass)**:
1. **Pass 1**: Match specific codes (`<engineers>` → value)
2. **Pass 2**: Collect unmatched items grouped by category
3. **Pass 3**: Fill category fallback slots sequentially (FIFO)

**Overflow Warning Display** (`src/app/modeling/page.tsx`):
- Tracks items that couldn't fit in category fallback slots
- Displays amber warning banner when overflow occurs
- Lists affected categories and item names
- Suggests adding more fallback rows to template

**Template Example**:

### Modeling System Overhaul - Two-Pass Codification System

**Overview**: Implemented a comprehensive two-pass codification system for the modeling section. This system bridges the gap between extracted financial data and template placeholders, enabling intelligent mapping of varied Excel terminology to normalized canonical codes.

**Architecture:**
The system uses a two-pass approach:
1. **Fast Pass** (Instant): Alias dictionary lookup during extraction - no LLM, ~50ms
2. **Smart Pass** (On-Demand): LLM-powered codification using OSS-120B when Data Library opens

**New Database Tables** (`convex/schema.ts`):
1. **extractedItemCodes**: Canonical code library (normalized, clean codes only)
   - Fields: code, displayName, category, dataType, isSystemDefault, isActive
   - Example: `<stamp.duty>` → "Stamp Duty" in "Purchase Costs" category
   
2. **itemCodeAliases**: Normalization layer (learning system)
   - Maps varied input terms to canonical codes
   - Fields: alias, aliasNormalized, canonicalCodeId, canonicalCode, confidence, source
   - Sources: system_seed, llm_suggested, user_confirmed, manual
   - Tracks usageCount for learning analytics
   
3. **codifiedExtractions**: Per-document codified data
   - Stores items with mappingStatus: matched, suggested, pending_review, confirmed, unmatched
   - Tracks fastPassCompleted, smartPassCompleted, isFullyConfirmed
   - Contains mappingStats for dashboard display

**New Convex Functions Created**:
- `convex/extractedItemCodes.ts`: CRUD operations for code library
- `convex/itemCodeAliases.ts`: CRUD operations for alias dictionary with bulk lookup
- `convex/codifiedExtractions.ts`: Codified data management with confirmation workflows

**New Codification Engines**:
- `src/lib/fastPassCodification.ts`: Fast alias lookup with fuzzy matching (Levenshtein)
- `src/lib/smartPassCodification.ts`: LLM-powered codification using Together.ai OSS-120B

**New API Route**:
- `/api/codify-extraction`: Handles fast-pass, smart-pass, confirm, and confirm-all actions
  - Fast Pass called after extraction to instantly match known aliases
  - Smart Pass called when Data Library opens with pending items
  - Confirm creates new aliases in dictionary (learning system)

**Enhanced Extraction Pipeline** (`src/app/api/analyze-file/route.ts`):
- Added Fast Pass preview after extraction
- Returns codificationPreview with stats (matched vs pending)
- Integrates with alias dictionary for instant matching

**New UI Components**:
1. **MappingConfirmationModal.tsx**: Review and confirm code mappings
   - Shows items needing review grouped by category
   - Options: Accept suggestion, Map to different code, Create new code, Skip
   - Creates aliases on confirmation (system learns)
   - "Accept All Suggested" button for bulk confirmation
   
2. **Overhauled DataLibrary.tsx**: 
   - Displays codified items grouped by category
   - Status indicators: matched (green), suggested (amber), pending (red), confirmed (blue)
   - Smart Pass trigger on load when items need review
   - Review banner with item count needing attention
   - "Ready to run model" indicator when fully confirmed

3. **Updated Item Code Management UI** (`/settings/modeling-codes`):
   - Two tabs: Item Codes and Alias Dictionary
   - Item Codes: Grouped by category, create/edit/delete
   - Alias Dictionary: Grouped by canonical code, view usage stats
   - Search and filter functionality

**Updated Modeling Page** (`src/app/modeling/page.tsx`):
- Added confirmation check before running models
- Queries codifiedExtraction for active document
- Blocks model run if items need confirmation
- Shows pending count in alert message

**User Experience Flow**:
1. Upload Excel → Extraction → Fast Pass (instant alias lookup)
2. Open Data Library → Smart Pass runs if items pending (30s LLM)
3. Review banner appears → Open MappingConfirmationModal
4. Confirm/map/create codes → Aliases saved (system learns)
5. All confirmed → "Ready to run model" indicator
6. Click Run Model → Template populated with codified data

**Learning System**:
- Month 1: 0% auto-matched (cold start), 100% needs LLM
- Month 2: 60% auto-matched as aliases accumulate
- Month 6: 95%+ auto-matched (only novel terms need LLM)

**Technical Details**:
- Fuzzy matching uses Levenshtein distance with 0.85 threshold
- OSS-120B model via Together.ai for smart codification
- Confidence scores tracked (0-1) for all mappings
- Alias usageCount incremented on each match

**Pages Affected**:
- Modeling
- Settings (Modeling Codes)

**Features Affected**:
- Data Library
- Financial Modeling
- File Upload/Extraction
- Code Management

### Simplified Metrics Cards - 4 Card Layout

**Overview**: Simplified the metrics cards from 5 cards to 4 more meaningful cards that fit better on one line.

**Changes:**
1. **Metrics Card Restructure**:
   - Removed "Total Tasks", "Upcoming (24h)", and "Completed (7d)" cards
   - Added "Active Tasks" - shows tasks that aren't completed or cancelled
   - Added "Active Reminders" - shows reminders with pending status
   - Kept "Up Next" and "Completed" cards
   
2. **Grid Layout**: Changed from 6-column to 4-column grid for better proportions

3. **New Convex Queries**:
   - Updated `tasks.getMetrics` to return `activeTasks` instead of `total`, `upcoming24h`, `completed7d`
   - Created `reminders.getMetrics` to return `activeReminders` count
   
4. **Final Card Layout**:
   - **Up Next** (1 column): Shows next task with time remaining or title if overdue
   - **Active Tasks** (1 column): Count of non-completed, non-cancelled tasks
   - **Active Reminders** (1 column): Count of pending reminders
   - **Completed** (1 column): Count of completed tasks

**Result**: All metric values are now fully visible with better spacing and more meaningful data.

5. **New API Endpoint**:
   - Created `/api/reminders/parse` endpoint using GPT-OSS-20B
   - Separate prompt optimized for reminder parsing
   - Handles client/project matching, time/date extraction
   - Fuzzy matching for client and project names

6. **Enhanced ReminderForm**:
   - Added `initialData` prop support for pre-filling parsed data
   - Can accept scheduledDate, scheduledTime, clientId, projectId from natural language
   - Seamless integration with natural language parsing flow

7. **Create Form Modal**:
   - Modal now adapts to active tab (tasks vs reminders)
   - Shows appropriate form (TaskFormCompact or ReminderForm)
   - Title updates dynamically based on context

**Technical Details:**
- `TaskNaturalLanguageInput.tsx`: Added `mode` prop (`'task' | 'reminder'`)
- `src/app/api/reminders/parse/route.ts`: New endpoint for reminder parsing
- `ReminderForm.tsx`: Added `initialData` interface prop

### Fixed Vercel Deployment 404 Issue

**Overview**: Resolved 404 deployment errors on Vercel by updating middleware configuration and adding proper Vercel deployment configuration.

**Changes Made:**
- **Middleware Updates** (`src/middleware.ts`):
  - Added `/login` and `/signup` routes to public routes matcher (in addition to `/sign-in` and `/sign-up`)
  - Ensures Clerk authentication redirects work correctly for all authentication routes

- **Vercel Configuration** (`vercel.json`):
  - Created `vercel.json` with proper Next.js framework configuration
  - Ensures Vercel correctly detects and builds the Next.js application

- **Deployment Documentation** (`VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md`):
  - Created comprehensive deployment troubleshooting guide
  - Documented common 404 error causes and solutions
  - Added checklist for verifying Root Directory settings in Vercel
  - Included debugging steps and environment variable requirements

**Root Cause:**
The 404 error was caused by Vercel deploying from the parent directory instead of the `model-testing-app` subdirectory. This prevented Vercel from finding the Next.js application files.

**Solution:**
Updated Vercel project settings to set Root Directory to `model-testing-app`, ensuring Vercel builds and deploys from the correct directory.

**Technical Details:**
- Middleware now properly handles all Clerk authentication routes
- Vercel configuration ensures proper framework detection
- All environment variables verified (Clerk keys, Convex URL)

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor deployment to ensure 404 errors are resolved
- Verify authentication flow works correctly on production
- Test all routes after deployment completes

### Enhanced Workbook Editor with Zoom and Multi-Sheet Support

**Overview:**
Added zoom functionality to the workbook editor and implemented proper multi-sheet support with sheet tabs replacing the data/output tabs when templates are loaded.

**New Features:**
- **Zoom Controls**: Added zoom in/out buttons and zoom level display to the FormulaBar
  - Zoom range: 50% to 200% (0.5x to 2.0x)
  - Zoom controls positioned to the right of the formula input
  - Formula input made smaller (max-width 60%) to accommodate zoom controls
  - Zoom applied using CSS transform for smooth scaling

- **Multi-Sheet Template Loading**: 
  - "Run Appraisal Model" now loads both the primary template and a second sheet (ID: kg24x42fmj1ns658s85wmy8hy17vhc22)
  - Both sheets are merged and displayed as separate tabs
  - HyperFormula engine persists across all sheets for cross-sheet formula calculations

- **Sheet-Based Tab Navigation**:
  - When templates are loaded, sheet tabs replace the "data/output" tabs
  - Each sheet appears as its own tab at the top level
  - Output tab remains available alongside sheet tabs
  - When no template is loaded, falls back to original "data/output" tabs

**Enhanced Components:**
- `FormulaBar.tsx`: 
  - Added `zoomLevel` and `onZoomChange` props
  - Added zoom in/out buttons with ZoomIn/ZoomOut icons from lucide-react
  - Displays current zoom level as percentage
  - Formula input constrained to 60% max-width to make room for controls

- `WorkbookEditor.tsx`:
  - Added zoom state management
  - Applied CSS transform scale to table containers for zoom effect
  - Added `activeSheet` and `hideTabs` props for external control
  - Zoom transform applied with proper origin and container sizing

  - Modified to load second sheet template (ID: kg24x42fmj1ns658s85wmy8hy17vhc22)
  - Replaced "data/output" tabs with sheet tabs when templates are loaded
  - Each sheet tab renders WorkbookEditor with all sheets (for HyperFormula persistence)
  - Maintains backward compatibility with original data/output tabs when no template loaded

**Technical Details:**
- Zoom implemented using CSS `transform: scale()` with `transformOrigin: 'top left'`
- Container width/height adjusted proportionally to maintain proper scrolling
- HyperFormula engine initialized once per WorkbookEditor instance with all sheets
- Cross-sheet formulas work correctly (e.g., `=SUM(Sheet1!A1:A10)`)

**Bug Fixes:**
